CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using 
this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that
makes up each web page.

Why we learn CSS?
Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made 
without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.

What does CSS mean?
Tags for formatting a web page were never intended in HTML. HTML was established to define a web page’s content. The addition of tags like <font> and color attributes to HTML created a 
big problem for web developers. The creation of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to each page, became a time-consuming and costly procedure. CSS was established 
to address this issue. CSS eliminated the HTML page’s style formatting.

How CSS is different from HTML?
	HTML is used to define a structure of a web page whereas CSS is used to style the web pages by using different styling features.
	HTML consists of tags inside which text is enclosed and CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks.
	CSS can be internal or external depending upon the requirement.
	We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet but we can use CSS inside an HTML document.
	CSS has comparatively higher backup and support than HTML.

Why is CSS used in HTML?
	Solves a big problem: Font, color, background style, element alignments, border, and size tags had to be duplicated on each web page before CSS. This was a lengthy procedure.
	Saves a lot of time: Because CSS style definitions are stored in external CSS files, updating only one file can modify the entire website.
	Provide more attributes: CSS gives more specific features for defining the look and feel of a website than simple HTML.
	Pages load faster: CSS doesn’t require you to write HTML tag attributes all of the time. A tag’s rule can be written once and applied to all instances of the tag. As a result, CSS uses less code, resulting in speedier download times.
	Easier Website maintenance: CSS makes website maintenance much easier. If we need to make a global change to the file, we can simply alter the style, which will update all of the elements on the web page.
	Multiple device compatibility: We can use CSS with older language versions because it is compatible with them. CSS makes it possible to optimize material for several devices.
	Base for web development: HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer should know. It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.
	Makes your website look attractive: A website that’s dull and plain will not attract the user, so adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.
	Makes the design come live: A web developer is responsible for making the design given to him as a live product. It is used for styling to develop the design of the website.
	Increases user experience of the website: A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would help the users to go through the website easily. It is used to make the user interface better.
	More career opportunities: Since CSS is a basic requirement while learning Web Development, therefor there are abundant career opportunities for it. As a freelancer, you can land up to many projects.

	A more specific selector takes precedence over a less specific one
	Rules that appear later in the code override earlier rules if both have the same specificity.
	A css rule with !important always takes precedence. 

9. Which of the following is/are true regarding external CSS? (multiple answers correct)
Answer: It helps in separating content related code and presentation related code of the website, It may or may not have lesser priority than internal CSS, It helps in writing less repeated code hence the loading time of the page decreases, 
It helps in easy debugging and maintenance of code, It is preferred over inline and internal CSS for styling purposes as you can not re-use inline or internal CSS with other HTML code files

10. Select the correct statements regarding Browser Developer Tools (multiple answers correct).
Answer: You can debug javascript code using it, You can debug CSS code using it, Once you refresh your web page in the browser, all the changes that you made in HTML using developer tools are gone




The .class selector is used to select all elements which belong to a particular class attribute. In order to select the elements with a particular class, use the period (.) character 
specifying the class name ie., it will match the HTML element based on the contents of their class attribute. The class name is mostly used to set the CSS property to a given class.

Syntax: 
	.class {
    		// CSS property
	} 

The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class. You can 
also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. To do this, start with the element name, then write the period (.) character, followed by the name of the 
class.

When more than one set of CSS rules apply to the same element, the browser will have to decide which specific set will be applied to the element. The rules the browser follows are 
collectively called Specificity.

Specificity Rules include:  
	CSS style applied by referencing external stylesheet has lowest precedence and is overridden by Internal and inline CSS.
	Internal CSS is overridden by inline CSS.
	Inline CSS has highest priority and overrides all other selectors.

Specificity Hierarchy :Every element selector has a position in the Hierarchy. 
	Inline style: Inline style has highest priority. 
	Identifiers(ID): ID have the second highest priority. 
	Classes, pseudo-classes and attributes: Classes, pseudo-classes and attributes are come next. 
	Elements and pseudo-elements: Elements and pseudo-elements have lowest priority. 




17. A HTML code is written as:
	<!DOCTYPE html>

The Nesting & Grouping concept is very important for a web developer to write precise codes. You can group and nest items to reduce the amount of code that you write, which will reduce 
the length of your code and allow pages to load faster. It is a way to simplify your code. With the help of Nesting and Grouping, we can be more specific in our code. In this article, we 
will see how nesting & grouping helps to optimize the code & make it efficient & increases readability.

Nesting: The nesting property in CSS facilitates nesting one style rule inside another, with the selector of the child rule that is relative to the selector of the parent rule. It helps 
to increase the modularity and maintainability of CSS stylesheets & hence increase the overall readability of the code. For instance, if you write a structured CSS module, instead of 
specifying the separate selectors for every HTML element ie, by using many classes or ID selectors, you can simply specify properties to selectors within other selectors. While nesting 
the CSS properties, HTML elements form a tree-structured shape. Nesting is a shortcut to create CSS rules for multiple selectors for a specific property. So, instead of rewriting the same 
set of properties for the different selectors, we can simply nest selectors inside other selectors. For this reason, we are not only reducing the size of the code but also reducing the 
overall loading time.

Syntax:
	class1_selector class2_selector id_selector  {
  		property: value;
	}

Grouping: Grouping is used to select the multiple elements together to apply the common styling properties to them. For this reason, it helps to reduce the length of the code that has 
multiple selectors with the same properties. This makes code easy to read. Page load times and development time for code are reduced as well when using grouping. Instead of writing this 
long code, specifying the same properties to different selectors.

We can group them and write like this & we need the comma(,) to group the various selectors.

	h1, p {
 		padding: 5px;
 		color: grey;
	}




20. How do you select all p elements inside a div element?
Answer: div p

21. How to apply specific styles to h1 tag only when mouse points to it?
Answer: h1:hover

22. If the elements - <p>, <h4> and <a> tags are needed to be of the orange color, then which of the following will do this?
Answer: h4, a, p { color: orange; }

23. How do you insert a comment in a CSS file?
Answer: /*this is a comment*/

24. How do you group multiple selectors?
Answer: Separate each selector with a comma

25. How to apply styles to para’s having class ‘style’? (There are other elements with same class name)
Answer: p.style

26. How to apply styles to all <span> element inside para’s having class ‘style’?
