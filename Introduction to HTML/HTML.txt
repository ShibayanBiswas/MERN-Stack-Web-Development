HTML helps us to create the structure of the webpage. Structure of the webpage means there are multiple elements like heading, paragraph, images, links, buttons, videos, tables, etc. which 
can be included using HTML. To beautify the webpage we need CSS. 
HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

For example let's visualise the google search page that is divided into three sections respectively. Section 1 is the header section. Section 2 is the main section. Section 3 is the footer 
section. These sections have multiple options available in them. For example we can see that section 1 has options like gmail, sign in and so on, section 2 has options like google image, google
search bar and so on, section 3 also has various options. This structure that we draw is a tree like structure. A natural HTML page is hiearchial. There is root at the top. Root can have children. 
Children can have further children and so on. We can complicate and divide it as per our requirement. To write down code we have to replicate the complete structure via code. Different tags
have different features. 

The <html> tag is just an indicator to show that we are starting our HTML code. HTML root has two fixed children HEAD and BODY. The part of the page visible to us is the BODY section. The
BODY section is the child of the HTML section. The HEAD tag is for the meta data part. Meta data part means some information about the page like TITLE. We write TITLE within the HEAD section.
Files and links are written under the head section. When we try to open a HTML page using a browser the browser tries to open it in the best possible way it can. Browser actualy fills in 
the basic code. 

To see this we right click and selct inspect to see the HTML code provided by the browser.

In HTML we have:
	Heading tag ranging from <h1> </h1> to <h6></h6> depending upon the size of the Heading we need.
	Paragraph tag <p> </p> for writing paragraphs inside our webpage.
	Break tag <br> is used to go to the new line. It is a single tag hence we do not close it.
	&nbsp means no break space. In order to help HTML place a space between two words we use it. We use this if we want the words to be more than a space apart.
	The <hr> tag in HTML stands for horizontal rule and is used to insert a horizontal rule or a thematic break in an HTML page to divide or separate document sections. The <hr> tag is an empty tag, and it does not require an end tag.
	HTML <img> tag is used to add image inside webpage/website. Syntax: <img src="" alt="" width="" height="">. Example: <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">
	The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.
